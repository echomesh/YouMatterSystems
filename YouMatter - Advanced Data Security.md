# 🔐 Active Trust Framework

### A DAG-Based Access and Credential Chain Model for UMATTER Systems

**UMATTER** — *You Orchestrate Unified Management, Access, Trust, Telemetry, Events, and Relationships.*

The Active Trust Framework redefines how trust is established, propagated, and revoked across federated systems. While it introduces a novel architecture, it **integrates seamlessly with existing platforms** — because it doesn't enforce *how* data is structured, only *how* it's accessed and trusted.

Instead of static role-based access models (RBAC) or brittle credential chains, this model leverages a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** that mirrors **relational trust propagation**, contextual awareness, and **zero-origin replay resistance**.

## 🌐 Interoperability by Design

This is not a rip-and-replace system. It’s a trust mesh that overlays on top of existing environments:

- **FHIR & HL7 Ready** – Built to parse and process identity and resource access via **HL7 events and FHIR schemas**.
- **Vendor-Neutral** – Whether data lives in Epic, Cerner, AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem — UMATTER maps *trust*, not the data models themselves.
- **Plug-and-Play DAG Anchoring** – Each platform becomes a node. Trust is contextually bound, not hardcoded.

## 🔑 Core Components

> UMETA or ECHO (UMETA ACT-DAG) access certificates can represent **users, devices, or endpoints**.  
> These certificates are **exportable and portable** — enabling seamless identity propagation.  
> For example, a certificate issued to an enterprise account can be stored in a local Windows certificate store,  
> allowing **passwordless authentication** for services like web access, device login, or API calls.

- **Graph Key**: A distributed cryptographic anchor tied to the system’s root cert.
- **DAG ACLs**: Access flows via relationship-aware graph edges, not static permissions.
- **Certificate Burning**: Seed credentials are destroyed post-initiation by **Lighthouse Robotics**, enforcing *zero-replay trust*.
- **Federated Trust Propagation**: Access propagates via **edge logic** — based on time, role, relationship, or signal.
- **Revocation as Traversal Update**: No need to revoke keys — just **mark the path stale**. No global state. Just local DAG logic.

## ✅ What This Enables

- **Contextual Access Control** — Governed by *who*, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *system state*.
- **Zero-Trust Ready** — Autonomous trust zones for cloud, IoT, edge, and mesh networks.
- **Dynamic Enforcement** — Trust is not static. It evolves with system context, signal flows, and graph shape.

> Think of it as **Git for Trust** — live DAG propagation + cert flows triggered by events, not humans.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Drop this file into `docs/security/active-trust.md` or inline into your README for now.
- Generate DAG ACL nodes dynamically as your IaC pipeline provisions infra.
- Anchor certificates using **ActiveShell + Graph Key injection**.
- Route **all identity/auth decisions through the DAG traversal layer**.

## 🧠 Why UMATTER?

UMATTER is about flipping the script.

- You orchestrate the trust.
- You define the boundaries.
- You determine how relationships evolve.

With UMATTER, trust isn't granted. It's earned — dynamically, relationally, and irreversibly.
